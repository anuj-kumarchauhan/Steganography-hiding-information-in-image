# Steganography – Hiding Information in the Image

## 🔐 Project Overview
This project implements secure steganography by combining **AES encryption** with **Least Significant Bit (LSB)** image embedding. It allows users to hide secret messages in images in a way that is visually undetectable.

## 🛠️ Features
- AES-256 encryption of messages
- LSB-based image steganography
- CLI-based tool for encoding and decoding
- Image quality preserved post-embedding
- Optimized decoding speed

---

## 🧪 Technologies Used
- **Language**: Python 3
- **Libraries**:
  - `cryptography` (for AES)
  - `Pillow` (for image handling)
  - `argparse` (for CLI)
  - `NumPy` (for pixel manipulation)
